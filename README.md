# _**ShiftOS: Shift it your way**_

## :question: **What is ShiftOS?**
> ShiftOS is a game about evolving an experiemental operating system called "ShiftOS" from a completly black and white text based command line environment to a fully graphical operating system filled with advanced features and beautiful colours.
> 
> The game is non-linear meaning you can focus on expanding and evolving ShiftOS anyway you like by earning codepoints and spending them in the Shiftorium with a range of upgrade options. Buy more programs, more colours, GUI upgrades and more while you discover the secret behind ShiftOS.
> 
> Be careful though... ShiftOS is more than just an operating system!

## :clock10:  **History of ShiftOS**
> ShiftOS started as a spiritual successor of Histacom, a project made by Philip Adams (known as 12padams or OSFirstTimer). It was developed under VB.NET using WinForms and have been through several development until it was handed over to a different developer as of 0.0.8 until the Alpha release of 0.0.9.
> 
> A return of ShiftOS known as ShiftOS-TheReturn was led by Michael The Shifter (known as acidiclights today) and have been spread through several aspects of the game such as Multiplayer-based game, Modification, etc. But the development was halted by an unknown group that demands to abandon ShiftOS.
> 
> After that, many iterations of revival and rewrite has been made. But most of those are either discontinued or in low activity. In November 1st, a revival project of ShiftOS has been made mainly by Everything Windows, it is going to be rewritten and reworked in VB.NET and later on migrates into C# and multi-platform support as the time progresses.

## :raising_hand: **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**
**Why is it written in VB.NET?**
> At first, I will write the code in VB.NET in order to make progresses of rewrite on the original code by Philip. After all features necessary are reworked, I will slowly migrate the code into C# while still using WinForms. And after reimplementing many functions from ShiftOS-TheReturn, We as the team will move into C++ and moving from WinForms to possibly Mono, from the migration to Mono, multi-platform support will be in work.

**Why do you want to revive ShiftOS?**
> I found the concept of ShiftOS to be astonishing and great to implement, it needs a proper implementation (even though sometime I kinda mess at the code). acidiclights' TheReturn did have a good concept and work, but the group who demands the abandonment extinguishes the project's activity all together. Since then, many attempt didn't go well. I hope with this iteration/attempt, it will have a proper implementation and support from the community

**Did you get the permission from Philip and Michael?**
> For Philip, I've already contaced to him via email as far back as 2020 back and forth. Long story short, Philip let me make the iteration and I am freely to take his code and reimplement that.
> As of Michael, since the game is open-source on GitHub and archived. According to the README.MD, I am allowed to use the code as long as I'm not reclaiming it fully as my own and put the credit and license in the code.

**Can I contribute to the project?**
> Yes, you can. You can take part of the projecy by contributing the code, either in VB.NET, C#, or C++ phase. Your contribution and support means the world to us as the team
