## :question: **What is ShiftOS?**
> ShiftOS is a game about evolving an experiemental operating system called "ShiftOS" from a completly black and white text based command line environment to a fully graphical operating system filled with advanced features and beautiful colours.
> 
> The game is non-linear meaning you can focus on expanding and evolving ShiftOS anyway you like by earning codepoints and spending them in the Shiftorium with a range of upgrade options. Buy more programs, more colours, GUI upgrades and more while you discover the secret behind ShiftOS.
> 
> Be careful though... ShiftOS is more than just an operating system!

## :clock10:  **History of ShiftOS**
> ShiftOS started as a spiritual successor of Histacom, a project made by Philip Adams (known as 12padams or OSFirstTimer). It was developed under VB.NET using WinForms and have been through several development until it was handed over to a different developer as of 0.0.8 until the Alpha release of 0.0.9.
> 
> A return of ShiftOS known as ShiftOS-TheReturn was led by Michael The Shifter (known as acidiclights today) and have been spread through several aspects of the game such as Multiplayer-based game, Modification, etc. But the development was halted by an unknown group that demands to abandon ShiftOS.
> 
> After that, many iterations of revival and rewrite has been made. But most of those are either discontinued or in low activity. In November 1st, a revival project of ShiftOS has been made mainly by Everything Windows, it is going to be rewritten and reworked in VB.NET and later on migrates into C# and multi-platform support as the time progresses.

## :floppy_disk: **Installing ShiftOS**
> Minimal system requirement :
>- Windows 7
>- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher
>- 512MB RAM
>- 64MB free space
>
> Recommended requirement (The list is a subject to change) :
>- Windows 10 or newer
>- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher
>- 1GB RAM or higher
>- at least 1GB of free space
>- Active internet connection (necessary for several features)
>
> To run ShiftOS, you need to download the latest release on the <a href="https://github.com/EverythingWindows/ShiftOS-TheRevival/releases/tag/0.2.5">Release</a>.
> If you download earlier version or you may have run it. The said version will check the latest version and automatically notify and recommend you to upgrade to the latest version.
> Once you have downloaded the latest version, you can run the executable `ShiftOS-TheRevival.vX.X.X.exe` and you can start playing ShiftOS.

## :hammer: **Building ShiftOS from source**
### 1.Prequisites
>- Windows 10 or newer
>- 4GB RAM or higher
>- at least 1GB of free space
>- Visual Studio 2019 or newer
> It hasn't been tested on Visual Studio 2017 or earlier, but presumably it works. Other IDE hasn't been tested out, so be careful if you want to build ShiftOS using different IDE
>
### 2.Clone the repository
> `https://github.com/EverythingWindows/ShiftOS-TheRevival.git`
> This will create a local copy of the repository
>
### 3.Compiling the project
> To start edit the project and compile it, open `ShiftOS-TheRevival.sln` and it will open Visual Studio (or corresponding IDE). Once it has opened, you can compile by using the Play button with `Debug` and `x86` option

## :raising_hand: **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**
**Why is it written in VB.NET?**
> At first, I will write the code in VB.NET in order to make progresses of rewrite on the original code by Philip. After all features necessary are reworked, I will slowly migrate the code into C# while still using WinForms. And after reimplementing many functions from ShiftOS-TheReturn, We as the team will move into C++ and moving from WinForms to possibly Mono, from the migration to Mono, multi-platform support will be in work.

**Why do you want to revive ShiftOS?**
> I found the concept of ShiftOS to be astonishing and great to implement, it needs a proper implementation (even though sometime I kinda mess at the code). acidiclights' TheReturn did have a good concept and work, but the group who demands the abandonment extinguishes the project's activity all together. Since then, many attempt didn't go well. I hope with this iteration/attempt, it will have a proper implementation and support from the community

**Did you get the permission from Philip and Michael?**
> For Philip, I've already contaced to him via email as far back as 2020 back and forth. Long story short, Philip let me make the iteration and I am freely to take his code and reimplement that.
> As of Michael, since the game is open-source on GitHub and archived. According to the README.MD, I am allowed to use the code as long as I'm not reclaiming it fully as my own and put the credit and license in the code.

**Can I contribute to the project?**
> Yes, you can. You can take part of the projecy by contributing the code, either in VB.NET, C#, or C++ phase. Your contribution and support means the world to us as the team
